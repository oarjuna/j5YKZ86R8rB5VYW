// assign some creeps to "tasks" instead of birthplace
- tasks are long term ongoing operations in a room, remote harvesting, attacks, other
// tasks can have multiple flags 'Task1' which can be used for destinations  and return ids
// normal deliverer creeps could be sent empty to a remote room and then return full
//

// Remote Harv Task - 2 sources
- 1x claimer ( spawns 2nd, reserves the controller )
- 1x builder ( spawns 1st, builds containers, remains until roadwork and containers are complete )
- 2x harvester ( spawns 3rd, harvests, repairs containers )
- 6x deliverer ( spawns 5th, hauls, repairs roads)
- soldier ( spawns 4th, fights)

.. it would be good to say 10% 80% 10% of all energy production split up into use categories

% for controller Upgrade
creep production
tower energy
construction


// builders should collect dropped resources

// creep recycling worthwhile?

// if a room is wiped out, set energy_avil to 300 until the hive regenerates, then switch back to normal levels

// stop hosing with the job queue thing for now and sort out basic attack/defense

towers
Attack effectiveness	600 hits at range ≤5 to 150 hits at range ≥20
100 capacity @ 10 per action == 6000 max damage until empty

Heals self or another creep restoring 12 hits per tick in short range or 4 hits per tick at a distance

// Defensive AI
-- set a state of alert
  -- upgraders suicide and don't respawn during alert
  -- spawn additional deliverers
  -- prioritize tower filling over spawn filling

-- create an army object
-- set jobs on the queue for each room's spawner to produce soldiers
-- assign newly spawned soldiers to an army
-- order the army object to defensive position

-- state of alert must be manually disabled

***** TODO FIRST
-- mineral hauling on the queue
-- marketer ai
  - sells off room resources and buys level 3 resources for boosting.
  - maintains inventory in case of attack
-- boosting / labs -- we won't win fights without boosted creeps
-- Spawning on the queue
-- repair / construction on the queue
